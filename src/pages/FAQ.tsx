      question: "How secure is my vote on Evotar?",
      answer: "Your vote is protected by secure session management. Each vote is immediately anonymized upon submission and cannot be traced back to you. We use role-based access controls and industry-standard security protocols to ensure the integrity of every election."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my vote after submitting?",
      answer: "No, once you submit your vote, it cannot be changed. This ensures election integrity and prevents vote manipulation. You'll see a confirmation dialog before finalizing your vote, so please review your selections carefully."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I forget my login credentials?",
      answer: "You can reset your password using the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page. If you don't remember your email or student ID, contact the SJCSI IT support or election administrators for assistance."
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't I access the voting system?",
      answer: "There are several possible reasons: 1) The election may not have started yet, 2) The election may have ended, 3) You may not be registered for this specific election, 4) Your account may need verification, or 5) You may not have the required voter role. Contact SJCSI election administrators if issues persist."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my vote was counted?",
      answer: "After submitting your vote, a vote receipt will automatically download, and you'll receive a confirmation screen showing your vote was recorded. You can verify your votes through the QR code in the vote receipt, just scan it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I vote from my mobile device?",
      answer: "Yes! Evotar is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices. You can vote securely from your smartphone or tablet using any modern web browser with the same security and functionality as a desktop."
    },
    {
      question: "What browsers are supported?",
      answer: "Evotar works on all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We recommend using the latest version of your preferred browser for the best experience and security."
    },
    {
      question: "How are election results verified?",
      answer: "Results are verified through our secure database system with comprehensive audit logs. Election administrators can verify the integrity of results through detailed voting session records while maintaining voter anonymity."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if there's a technical issue during voting?",
      answer: "If you experience technical difficulties, try refreshing your browser first. Your voting session is automatically saved, so you won't lose your progress. If issues persist, contact Evotar technical support immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can see how I voted?",
      answer: "Your vote is completely anonymous. No one, including system administrators, can see how you voted. The system only records that you participated in the election through voting sessions, not your specific candidate choices."
    },
    {
      question: "What roles exist in the system?",
      answer: "Evotar has four main roles: Voters (can cast votes), Staff (can manage approved elections), Admins (can create elections and manage all aspects), and Super Admins (full system access; developer of Evotar). Your role determines what features you can access."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I become a candidate?",
      answer: "To become a candidate, you need to follow SAO's candidate registration process. Once registered, you'll submit your candidate information, including bio, platform, qualifications, and educational background. SAO staff or admins will review and approve candidates before they appear in elections."
